The key aspect of this project is encryption and decryption for secure data transfer without any data loss.
This project was developed using python programming language.
The process of this project goes from converting the given text file into ASCII values of each character which is then mapped with RGB  color combination vectors.
The RGB vectors are grouped into pixels and all pixels are combined to form a image(which is encrypted).
This process is reversed to get the original text file.
